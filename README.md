# LaravelStuff
Just messing around with Laravel 5.

Just a simple Laravel 5 MVC website with backend database and a smimple blog posting system. 

 Each blog post has </h2>
  A many to many relationship between each blog post and categoreies.
  A one to Many relationship between a blog post and each comment. 
  A one to one relationship between a blog post and its author. 
  
  
Any new posts are currently entered via PHPMYADMIN but will implement a simple CMS to allow creating and editing of each blog post, categories and any realtionships.
